# Waste Management Web

This project is a Web Application.

The non-biodegradable waste management system. The system enables staff to record the waste collected as transactions, 
and the system can show the current capacity of the collection bins. 

The frontend of the system was built with HTML, CSS Bootstrap and javascript. 
The backend of the system was built with PHP, and database with MySQL.

This system is still a prototype and development still in progress.
